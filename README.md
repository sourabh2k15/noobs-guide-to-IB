# noobs-guide-to-IB

hola ! this is a quick getting started guide to contribute to Instantbird (aka IB ). The already available docs and resources are "elaborate and enough", but afterall a noob can only understand a noob's language.

the go-to resource for all problems, if it is not solved by reading this guide ( as it may get a bit obsolete, by the time you are viewing ) is #instantbird IRC channel on server: irc.mozilla.org

First things foremost:

1) If you are not using IB, why aren't you ? I particularly use it because it becomes a one stop for all of my chats hangouts, IRC on freenode, mozilla, snoonet, twitter ( I wish it had facebook, whatsapp and telegram also :) )
GO NOW GIVE IT A TRY, it is AWESOME and it is OPEN SOURCE ( oops both are synonyms duh! )

2) Intro tour, where you will understand half of the things required and maybe wouldn't need this guide

noobtricks:-

1) If you are new to IRC , use kiwiIRC an online IRC client ( easy to use ), but remember you can always use IB for IRC chats later . ( IB devs don't swear on me , the kid has just downloaded IB let alone configure the server details of IRC ;) )

pick a sassy nick and dive in.

Feel free to ask any questions about anything "RELATED TO IB", although I didn't do it most of the time in my noob stage, but yeah respect the time and energy people put in to answer noobs like us , repeatedly every once in a while.
